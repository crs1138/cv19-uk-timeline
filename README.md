# COVID-19 The UK Timeline

This project is documenting a sequence of events that took place in the UK and around the globe in connection with the
2019+ coronavirus pandemic. The initial collection of the events has been done by Emma Plunkett and completed, edited
and verified by a friend of Emma who wishes to remain anonymous.

It started off as a [CSS exercise](https://codepen.io/crs1138/full/QWjZRRb) for an artist's website. It utilizes 
ReactJS, SCSS for the frontend and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) for the backend. I seized the opportunity to try a
new technology as well as practice and improve my frontend skills.
