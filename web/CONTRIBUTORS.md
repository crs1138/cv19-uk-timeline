# Contributors

The CV19-UK-Timeline has been an initiative started by three main contributors. Thanks to all of them for their work!

This list is manually curated to include valuable contribution by volunteers that do not include code. They, however,
help in other ways such as content research, content editing, communication, providing feedback, or mockups.

Please edit this list to include new contributors as they come in. There is no particular order to the list. If you or
someone else was omitted from the list, rest assured it was not intentional. Please, let us know and we'll make it 
right.
