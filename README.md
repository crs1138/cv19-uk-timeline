# CV19-UK-Timeline

This project is documenting a sequence of events that took place in the UK and around the globe in connection with the
2019+ coronavirus pandemic. The initial collection of the events has been done by Emma Plunkett and completed, edited
and verified by a friend of Emma who wishes to remain anonymous.

To see the app in action, head over to [CV19-UK-Timeline](https://crs1138.github.io/cv19-uk-timeline).

The author of the original code is Jan Poživil (@crs1138). This whole project is a programming exercise to explore the 
possibilities of using [Sanity – headless CMS](https://www.sanity.io/) together with the frontend Web SPA (Single Page 
Application) written in React. The anonymous content contributor wishes to keep copyright to the content, but we'd like 
to encourage you to use, copy, modify or even better contribute to the codebase of this project.
